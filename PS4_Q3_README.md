This code is a hydro solver for adiabatic shocks using a donor cell advection scheme (solves the full series of hydro equations: mass, 
momentum, and energy conservation). A strong adiabatic shock (energy) is evolved with reflective boundary conditions on both sides. 

Output: animation of the evolution of density and Mach number.
