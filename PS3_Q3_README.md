This project visualizes lava flowing down an inclined slope (accounting for gravity) by numerically solving the 1-dimensional advection-diffusion equation. 
The x-axis is perpendicular to the fluid flow, the plane (no slip boundary condition) is on the left edge of the simulation box and the air-lava interface 
(no-stress boundary condition) is on the right. The solution asymptotes to the steady-state solution, which is overplotted for visualization.

Output: animation of the time-evolution of the velocity field of lava flow (shown below).
