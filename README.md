PS2_Q3:

This project visualizes two vortex rings moving in the same direction as they interact and "leapfrog" one another. Their behaviour is visualized by the movement of their cross-sections. I define the initial cross-section centers and circulation for each vortex, and the optimal timestep parameters for visualization. 

Output: plot of vortex cross-section positions and streamlines at each timestep and a gif of the total movement. 

Briefly consulted with Lekima during the coding process.
